# My Journey Through Building Fundamental Systems

This repository documents my progress through a series of projects where I'm building fundamental computer science concepts from the ground up. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these systems work under the hood.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I believe that the best way to truly understand something is to build it yourself. By recreating these essential tools and systems, I aim to:

* **Solidify my understanding of core computer science principles.**
* **Improve my problem-solving and debugging skills.**
* **Gain practical experience with various programming languages and paradigms.**
* **Develop a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my abilities.**
* **Challenge myself and have fun!**

## Projects

This is the list of projects I plan to tackle, along with their current status. I'm following a roughly progressive order, starting with foundational concepts and moving towards more complex distributed systems.

| Project | Status | Technologies Explored | Description  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :------ |
| [Build Your Own Git](./git)             | In Progress  | Python, Hashing            | Explore distributed version control by implementing a simplified version of Git, focusing on object storage and content addressing.                          |

## Progress and Updates

I'll be regularly updating this repository with my code, notes, and reflections on each project. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or even contribute! Each project will have it's own folder, inside each folder a README.md file will describe the progress of that specific project.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback! If you have ideas for improving these projects or want to point out errors, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
